# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Application-using-Streamlit
- Created a web application using Streamlit to predict diamond prices based on carat, cut, color, clarity level, depth, table, length,
 and width features.<br>
- Utilized a Random Forest model, trained on a comprehensive dataset, to deliver accurate price estimates for users.<br>
- MLflow for tracking and monitoring model performance, ensuring reliable analysis.<br>
- Employed Prefect as an ML Pipeline Orchestration tool to manage the workflow and pipeline infrastructure, transforming Jupyter Notebook 
 code into production-ready Python scripts<br>
 Technologies : Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Prefect, MLFlow

Note:- Main Model 'random forest' is not added to repo bcoz big file size, i tired using git lfs but error is occuring, iam rectifying the issue.Thankyou<br>
